        <h1>Getting Started with My99Exch: Register, Login, and First Bet</h1>
        <p>So you want a My99Exch account. Look, the whole process takes about 10 minutes and most of that is waiting for the UPI payment to confirm. Here's how it actually works.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Honestly? It's just a WhatsApp conversation. You message the number, say you want a new ID, pick a deposit amount, pay via UPI or Paytm, and you get your username and password. We get this question a lot, and yeah, that's really all there is to it. The <a href="https://my99exchvip.com/my99exch-register/">My99Exch register</a> page has the current WhatsApp number and minimum deposit details.</p>

<h2>First Login</h2>
<p>Once you've got credentials, head to the login page. Bookmark it because the URL can change occasionally. The <a href="https://my99exchvip.com/my99exch-login/">My99Exch login</a> page always has the latest working URL plus what to do if you can't get in. First thing after login: change your password. Just do it. Takes 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>The App</h2>
<p>Basically everyone uses the app instead of the browser. It's just faster and the bet placement is smoother. From what we've seen, about 90% of active users are on mobile. The <a href="https://my99exchvip.com/my99exch-app/">My99Exch app</a> page has download links. It's a small APK, installs in under a minute on any Android phone. No Play Store, just direct download.</p>

<p>Quick tip from us: enable notifications in the app settings. You'll get alerts when markets open for upcoming matches, which is handy during IPL when there's a match almost every day.</p>

<p>Not gonna lie, the app design isn't going to win any beauty contests. But it works, it's fast, and that's what counts when you're trying to place a bet during a live match.</p>
